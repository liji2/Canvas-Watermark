### Config
The watermarker allows user customizetheir watermark within certain limits<br>
```
# config.ini
[Default]
alpha = 0.1
Font = Helvetica
FontSize = 14
# Color 0.0 - 1.0
FontColorR = 0.4
FontColorG = 0.5
FontColorB = 0.3
PageWidth = 300
PageHeight = 500
```
We expect that the work of adding watermarks can be further scripted, just like we tried in config.ini.
